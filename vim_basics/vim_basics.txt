If you're already in vi, you can use the goto command. To do this, press Esc , type the line number, and then press Shift-g . If you press Esc and then Shift-g without specifying a line number, it will take you to the last line in the file.

#if you don't configure the .bashrc, then when you close the terminal the aliases that you have written would not persist, so you won't be able to use them when you open a new terminal.

-> so to overcome above drawback use .bashrc for setting below values.
---.bashrc-- write these in bashrc --so that all these are available in all terminals.
vi .bashrc  # open file, press PgDn button on key board and enter 'o' to get onto new line and shift to insert mode.

alias ckd='cd /etc/kubernetes/manifestes/'

Use the history command to reuse already entered commands or use even faster history search through Ctrl r .

toggle vim line numbers

When in vim you can press Esc and type :set number or :set nonumber followed by Enter to toggle line numbers. This can be useful when finding syntax errors based on line - but can be bad when wanting to mark&copy by mouse. You can also just jump to a line number with Esc :22 + Enter.

copy&paste
Get used to copy/paste/cut with vim:

Mark lines: Esc+V (then arrow keys)-> (shift+v)
Copy marked lines: y -> yank
Cut marked lines: d  -> delete
Past lines: p or P   -> paste
Indent multiple lines
To indent multiple lines press Esc and type :set shiftwidth=2. First mark multiple lines using Shift v and the up/down keys. Then to indent the marked lines press > or <. You can then press . to repeat the action.
